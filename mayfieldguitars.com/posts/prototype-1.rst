documentation of prototype 1 mayfield ave
=========================================

Strings:

 - standard E tuning and balanced .011 to .052. Standard 0.011 should work too.

   The string gauge shall be matched by the truss-rod and the bridge springs; thus
   please refrain from switching to a different tuning or a different string gauge.


Neck:

 - 10in to 16in variable radius from Warmoth;
   it feels more like an Ibanez than a Fender as a consequence.

 - lightly scalopped fretboard

 - semi-gloss finishing


Pick-ups:

 - Pickup Neck:   Dimarzio Vintage Blues

 - Pickup Middle: Dimarzio Virtual Vintage 54 Pro

 - Pickup Bridge: Dimarzio Virtual Solo

Lessons Learned
---------------

misaligned tuning machines
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

I used a hand drill + eyeballing to locate and drill the alignment holes for the tuning machines.
This was bad: the tuning machines would not fit in and I had to enlarge some of the holes to 1/8 inches.

I should have used a drill press, and should have printed blueprints for the location of the alignment holes.

neck pocket and bridge aligment
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Warmoth body seems to be incompatible to 6-screw vintage (vintage narrow) bridges.

The bridge tends to sit too low relative the neck after the neck is installed to the pocket.
I had to raise the saddle screws to a ridiculous amount to get a reasonable string action, and this caused
all sorts of instability on the bridge side (e.g. when tuning the intonation).

As a solution I routed the neck pocket down by about 1/16 inches. This fixed the alignment of the bridge,
but as a side-effect the pick-guard plate is now locked by the 22th-fret board extension.
To reinstall the pick-guard place, one needs to remove the neck.

Also I did not use a mill, but used a plunge tool that ran out of support. As a result the neck pocket is
slightly unlevel, and I had to insert a piece of paper next to the inner edge of the pocket to compensate
for the unlevelness.
