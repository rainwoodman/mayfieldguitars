This page is under coonstruction. A few photos here and there would be
very nice. I have the materials, but didn't have the chance to upload them.

maintenance
===========

strings
-------

- standard E tuning and balanced .011 to .052. Standard 0.011 should work too.

  These strings are cheap. Please keep them in stock.
  The string gauge shall be matched by the truss-rod and the bridge springs; thus
  please refrain from switching to a different tuning or a different string gauge.


neck
----

- 10in to 16in variable radius from Warmoth;

  The neck feels more like an Ibanez than a Fender as a consequence; curse or
  blessing, I am not so sure. My next build will be classical 9.5in for sure.


- lightly scalopped fretboard;

  This is very lightly scalopped (1/16in) comparing to usual scalloped guitars.
  I measured the depth according to the shape of my own finger tips.

- semi-gloss finishing;

  because gloss is gross, and satin is dull.


pick-ups
--------

- Neck:   Dimarzio Vintage Blues

- Middle: Dimarzio Virtual Vintage 54 Pro

- Bridge: Dimarzio Injector Bridge

I did not quite like the combination of the pick-ups. The guitar sounded a bit
too heavy. It is all messed up due to the Injector.
I will not use a Injector Bridge in my next build.
The vintage Blues could worked better on the Bridge, and the Vintage 54 on the neck.
The middle could used an Area 61-ish.

mechanical issues
=================

This is the first guitar that I built from raw components. Before this I mostly hacked on
existing finished guitars. A few lessons-learned notes here:

- misaligned tuning machines

  I used a hand drill + eyeballing to locate and drill the alignment holes for the tuning machines.
  This was bad: the tuning machines would not fit in and I had to enlarge some of the holes to 1/8 inches.

  I should have used a drill press, and should have printed blueprints for the location of the alignment holes.

- neck pocket and bridge aligment

  Warmoth body seems to be incompatible to 6-screw vintage (vintage narrow) bridges.

  The bridge tends to sit too low relative the neck after the neck is installed to the pocket.
  I had to raise the saddle screws to a ridiculous amount to get a reasonable string action, and this caused
  all sorts of instability on the bridge side (e.g. when tuning the intonation).

  As a solution I routed the neck pocket down by about 1/16 inches. This fixed the alignment of the bridge,
  but as a side-effect the pick-guard plate is now locked by the 22th-fret board extension.
  To reinstall the pick-guard place, one needs to remove the neck.

  Also I did not use a mill, but used a plunge tool that ran out of support. As a result the neck pocket is
  slightly unlevel, and I had to insert a piece of paper next to the inner edge of the pocket to compensate
  for the unlevelness.
